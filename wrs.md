###**1) Shady Auto**
Shady Auto is an auto shop that supplies very cheap services that come with some corners cut. We supply costumes with used oem parts for a fraction of the price and if we don't have it our overnight parts guys will find it. Our prices are the lowest out of all local shops. Many times our customers have their mirror or wheel stolen and coincidentally we all always have them. Our range of parts is unbeatable. We have a database that has all our parts and potential parts. This database also has all your vehicle history and required maintenance.


##**World Assumptions:**
Users have different layers of access to customer and store info
Users have access to if parts are stolen and were from to charge accordingly 
Users are given 2 different menus one legitimate and illegitimate.

##**User Requirements:**
They need a digital system for inventorying, managing, and invoicing customers with the addition of all types of managerial systems for employees(payroll and schedule making) with the addition of parts inventory and consumables(oil, washer fluid, wiper blades). This system has to have 2 parts: the legitimate business and the shady side ‚ÄúChop shop‚Äù. This is why there has to be many layers of access (boss,manager,sales rep ,employee). The software will only be used by trained professionals.


##**Specifications and Interface Needs:**
Admin powers 
2 inventories for parts and vehicles 
History on vehicle and bills
Billing with both inventorying systems(stolen parts and non stolen)
Payroll and scheduling 
Program and Hardware:
Developing an application using Java and its frameworks.
Ex file with file saving


###**2) Create a GitHub project for this idea and put the WRSPM in the project repo.

###3) Party and Event Planner System:
We have planned to meet on friday nights and were very flexible with our schedule and all of us would be able to set aside 10-15 min to talk about our project. We will meet either with a group phone call or discord and record the interaction using OBS or screen recorder on the iphone.
